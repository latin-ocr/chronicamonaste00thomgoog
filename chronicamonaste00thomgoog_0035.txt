wanted the money for a pilgrimsge to Jerusalem. His
father, Robert, who bad held the important office of
sheriff of Yorkshire, afterwards became a monle in the
monastery.

William Fossard the head of a distinguished Yorkshire
family, gave to the monastery two carucates of land in
Wharrom,—as far as five and twenty miles from the mo-
nastery, to the west of north-with the spring and water·
