describes the abbots going out of the city to meet the
archbiehop and getting off their horses and knoeling
ιο him, the archbishop returning the courtesy. Declin-
ing the advice to present themselves to the king
on his entry into Lincoln on the following day, from
apprehension of violence from the royal outriders,
the abbots held a meeting in the open plain outside the
city to consider the course they should follow. While
some were counselling one thing, some another, and the
arnount they might offer by way ol compromise was prin-
cipally discusscd, the chronioler states that the abbot of
Meaux, who had been formerly the notary of the aroh-
bishop‚ und on thet account was much in hie confi-
dcnoe, produceda oopy ol a letter from the gencml chapter
ol the Oisteroians to the archbishop, praying him ιο give
his assistance to the order in England in this matter, and
urging that it would be better that that branch of the
order should even suffer shipwreok than yield ιο the
king's unjust exactions3 for that it would be dangerous
ιο make an agreement with king John which might be-
come a precedent for similer extortions by other princes
The result of this movement of our abbot Alexander,
aooompenied doubtless by an address of his own in the
same spirit, was ιο bring the meeting ιο a resolution ιο
refuse any promise of payment ιο the king which could
endanger the liberties of their order hercafter.¹

He had already made the king his enemy by influ-
enoing Geoffrey, arehbiehop of York, and the biehope
generally, to carry their complaints against him to the
court of Rome, arrd he was soon to be brought into direct
collision with the angry monarch. John hed demanded
asubsidy of the churoh forhie expedition against Ireland.
A certain proportion of this was ussessed on the monue-
teriee of the Cistercian order. Again they refused ιο
pay without consent of the father ebbot of the order.
