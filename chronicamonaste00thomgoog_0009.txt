'Phe works to be published in octavo, separately‚ as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task

resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of tho lhcasury.

'Phe Lords of Her Majesty’s Trcasury, aster a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
lheasruy Minuta, dated February 9,1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of tho Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment oi this important
national object, inan effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be

paid lo economy, in making the detailed arrangements,
without unnecessary expensc.”

They expressod their approbation of the proposal that
each chroniclc and historioal document should be edited
in such amanner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from acollation of the
best MSS, and that no notes should bc added, except
such as were illustrative of tho various readings They
suggested, however, that the prefacc to each work should
contain, in addition to the particula-rs proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, abiographical account of the author,
so far as authentia materiale existed sor that purpose,
and an estimato of his historica] eredibility and valuo.
