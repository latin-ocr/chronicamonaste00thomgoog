thirty marks were raised by these sales.¹

The other resouroes of the monastery would be the
sale of their wool, always a considerable item, their farm
produce, and live stcck. After the exhaustion of these
means, the only remaining source of supply would be by

monks distributed themselves, not, aa was the onatom,
among monasterias of their order in England, for none
was able to receive them ; but some were received bytho
abbot of St. Marys oi York, others by the prior of Brid-
lington‚ some were sent to Cistercian houses in Scotland,
while others, an unexampled case in the history of the
order, were driven to seek molter-monks and converte,
ten or fifteen together, or at least by twos and thueca-in
neighbouring villages and eastles, where they could best

um. ever, was not of long duration. They were all reunitcd,

we may imagine with what feelings of delight, on the
let of November following. But it isnatural tc reflcct
that if the manner of life of the monks was at all of the
seeluded and ascetio character the constitutions of the
order enjoined, their forced return into tbe world must
have aadly discomposed their ideas, and probably for
some time atter the event diverted them hom holier
meditatione by the temptatiou to compare their several
adventures.
