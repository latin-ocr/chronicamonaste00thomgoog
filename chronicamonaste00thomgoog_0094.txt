inventory to have been deposited in the church and
cloister. '

In these earlier sections of English history our chro-
nicler has little to add to the events recorded in authors
now extant. In the later portione, in which he ap-
proaehes more nearly his own period, his narrative
shows many variations froin received authorities, and
these will be examined at a future opportunity.

With respect to the works referred to in the margins, Δ

Ι may shortly state that those 01 Ailred 01 Rivaulx,
Ralph de Diceto, John 01 Brompton, and Thomas stubba,

are quoted from the “Scriptores X.’' 01 Roger Twysden,
folio, 16523 as is also the Polychronicon 01 Ralph
Higden, the seventh hook 01 which is incorporated in the
Chronicle 01 Hemy Knighton, in the same collection.
Henry of Huntingdon and Roger Hoveden are cited
from the “Scriptores post Bedam '’ 01 Sir Henry Savile,

10110, 1601; Benediot 01 Peterborough, as edited by
Heame ; and William 01 Malmesbury, Nicholas Trivet,
Walter of Hemingsord, and William 01 Newbury‚ in the
editions 01 the English Historieal Society 01 London.

I cannot dismiss these remarks without again express·
ing my obligations to Sir Thomas Phillipps for his
kindness in allowing me access to his valuable copy 01
the chronicles, and in favouring me with facilities for
transcribing and collating it, in repeated visits to his
library at Oheltenham.
