“ Thomas Burton, nonus decimus abbas de Melea, obiit

“ quarto nonas Octobris, anne Domini cccc⁰xxxvl1⁰.

‘⁴ Sua anima in paee req[uiescat].’' The figure holds a
broken crozier, to indicate his retirement from the office

ef abbot previous to his death. We have it, therefore,

err the best authority that he survived to the year 1437.

Ι may add that the change iu Burton's handwriting ln
tlre great register ol his own compilation, Cottouian MS.
Vitellius C. vi., renrarlrobly confirma the statement that r
he lest his eyesiglrt iu the later years of his life.

The abbot of Fountains, in accepting the resignation
of Burton, assigned to him for the remainder of his life
aehamber irr the mouks’ infirmary, an annual pensiori
of forty shillings, with other liberties and favours¹ A
position more favourable forthe composition of a literary
work euch as he engaged himself in we ean hardly
conceive.

Tua It remeius to inquire from what sources Burton
ζζζῗξζξοῑ derived the materiale for his clironiele. He would have
iasorma- aecess to the arehires of the monastery, containing the
‘¹⁰⁰' original elrarters ol donation οἰ their estates, papal
bulla ol privileges and royal confirmations, as far
as they were preserved, and to such registers of these
documenta aa may have been extant attha time he
was writing. A portion of one such chartulary we have
seen is still extant, cornposed not long before Burton
would lrave commenced his work, and in which I have
pointed out additional entries in his own hand; and he

quotes a register of the monastery in the teodary which

he himself compiled. Having held the office of buraar,
he would have had in his keeping the accounts ol
reeeipts and issues oi the general purae, which, is they
extended far back, he must have found invuluable for

ιΙΙίιι predecessor, William os teenmarkaudoubleportionossoed,
Searborough, on hia resignation, two savants, and a monk es ser·
