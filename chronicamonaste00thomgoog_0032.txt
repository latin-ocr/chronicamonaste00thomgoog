'plough land, with pastura for as many oows, in Ho'ton
in Whitbystrand, with St. Leonard's hermitage there;‚
also a stretch of pastore on the Humher‚ known by the -
names os Saltagh and N ewland, witha carucate¹ of
land close by in Kayingham, about ten miles away
southward from the monastery} The convent, how·
ever, was tricked into giving as much as sixty marks-l s,
some 600l., estimated in modern coin and valae—to buy
off all claime on the property. With a view to the
convenience of the monks in access to the country south
of 'the Humher, the earl conferred on them the impor-
tant right of free passage at aplane called at that time
Pagula, now Paul, and also a house at Hedon, where they
might find harbourage in going to and returning srom
Saltagh aud the serry at Paul.

The chronicle does honour to the founder of tlre
monastery by recording the genealogy of his family, adding
that he survived the foundation twenty-nine years, and
was buried at Thornton abbey, a house of his own crea·
tion. It is gratifying to find that in his lifetimo he
was not without some soloce from his generosity to the
four abbeys he had originated and endowed. We are r
assured that, in his frequent passages of the senon rnili-
tary expeditione, when the storm raged he would lie
restless and in conceivable discomfort‚ until midnight, at
which hour his Cluniae and Augustinian monks of Aumale
and 'lhornton were rising to their nocturne, when, con-
fiding in their prayers, he would quietly fall asleep3 and
at cockcrow, if he woke again, he was once more lulled
to elumber by remembering that the Cistercian brethren
of Vaudey and Meaux were hastening to chent their
vigile. ·
