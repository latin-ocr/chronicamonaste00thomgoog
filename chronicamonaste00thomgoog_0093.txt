trey's narrative oi the knight Owsn's vision cf the
Purgatory ol St. Patrick.

9. “ De archiepiscopis Eboracsnsibus: '¹ the chronicis

10. “ Pars ds historia anglorum :’' possibly, as con-
jectured by Poulson in his History of Holderncss, a
portion of Bede's '‘ Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglo- .
‘⁴ rum ;'’ or, it may be, ol Hemy oi Huntingdon’s His·

had exclusive property in thess books, or having so much
occasion sor the use oi them, and iu the servies ol ths ’

chumber3 and theton this account they were not entered
