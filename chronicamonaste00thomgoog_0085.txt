the reader not to attribute to his invention what he may

nd new to him in the ensuing narrative, for he may be
assured that he states nothing for which he has not
authority, either in the works of others, and in different
memoranda (including, wc may presumo, the charters of
the house), or in tlre relation of trustworthy persons, or
in his own observation.

But wc have something more than infercnce of the
existence of narrative pieees at the time when Burton
composed his work ; we have direct references to them by
himself in his own register of documenta relating to the
monastery, which we have already described; and we
have an cntry afa history of the abbey in the inventory
of the conventnal library contained in the same volume. -

At folio 103 of the register compiled by Burton, he
gives an historieal view of the question of exemptiones
lande, hold by the monastery in their own cultivation, ·
from thc paymcnt of tithe. In the course of it hc makes
frequent reference to authorities, in these terme, “sicut
“ patet per cronicas et alia monasterii memoranda ;’'
‘¹ sieut patet per cronicam monasterii do tempore Adra
“abbatis primi ;” and similarly for every abbot down
to Michael, the eighth abbot, whose period was from 1235
10 1249. It might be understood that in these references
Burton was quoting his own work, as, indeed, the sub-
ject treated of is usually to be forrnd there; but that
these chronicles of the earlier abbate were distinct from
his own namative is rendered certain by other references,
in these tenne, “sicut patet per cronicam antiquam
“ monasterii de tempore Thomee abbatis 3‚” (ob. 1197),
folio 110t; aad “sicut patet per parvum rotulum
“ antiquae cronicae monasterii, armo Domini naccxv.,” on
the same page; and, again, “in antiqua cronica monas·
“ terii anno ab incarnatione Domini mecxrl.,” folio 111;
and, finally, “sicut patet per antiquum rotulum cronicas
‘⁸ ternpore Michaelis abbatie,” viz, from 1235101219,
folio 134.
