We may conclude, therefore, from his appoaring in this
list of the (late 01'1394 as twenty-second in seniority
out of a total number of only twenty-eight, of which the
convent was composed that Burton must have been a
monk of not many years’ standing, and probably under
thirty years of age.

The position and duties of 'bursar would be of advan-
tage in preparing him for the work of compiling the
history of the house. He would have aocess to the
recorda, and would bo led to make himself sully ac-
quainted with the actual condition of the affairs of tho
monastery, and probably to investigate the titles to
its several properties. 1 think it likely that he com·
menced the composition os his chronicle whilst holding
the office. What was the exact nature of his duties as
servitor to the abbot I am not aware; but it would
probably obtain from him the confidence of the ruler of
the house, and give him a knowledge of the most impor-
tant business of the convent I have met with nothing
to indicate the cause of his loss of office at llartinmas in
the year 13943 unless it might be connected with cer-
