D· ure But a great missortune befel the monastery from an
{hersf unforeseen cause. William Fossard died, leaving un only
Thurnhm child, a girl under age, who was given in marriage by

of Kent The widow of Fossord claimed the monastery's
land in Wharrom as her dower. Litigation ensued, at·
tended with great expense and much trouble to the house.
They were at last obliged to buy off her claim by paying
her a pension of ten pounds a year, afterwards com·
muted for a piece of land. N otwithstanding this settle·
ment, Sir Robert de Thurnham subsequently laid claim
to the estate of Wharrom aa his wife's inheritcnoe. He
prevailed in his suit, and Wharrom grange, with all its
apportenanees, was seized into the king’s hand by
Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, tho king’s justiciary,
who, the chronicle protests, was an unscrupulous favourer
of their opponent. Heavy expensos, no doubt, attended
Luam this unhnppy lawsuit. To nra-ke matters worse, while
iffi& the convent was being drained of its money and losing

wheat became excessivo. A quarter sold for thirteen
shillings end scurpenee, something like ten pounds of
present ralue. The monks had lo buy largoly at this
famine price. To complete their ruin they were obliged
to sell their wool, churoh plate, and what treasure they
had, to raise the sum of 300 marks towards king Richard's
&cono ransom. They were, in fact, ruined for the time, and
ffiflcigss again obliged to disperse, and for fifteen months they

During this period, “ as if they were under the wrath of
“ the Lord,'' the chroniclesoya, a'mill, in which as much as
a hundred sextaries of corn was stored, took fire and was
entirely consumed. A friendly hand, however, restored
