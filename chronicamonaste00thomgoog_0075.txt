tain dissensione in the convent, whicl1,Burton speaks ’
of, under william, the eighteenth abbot, on occasion ofa
claim to the office of perpetual claustral prior by a monk
who had successfully prosecuted a suit in the court of
Rome¹

nis elec· For the events relating to Burton's election ae abbot,

{iffi and to his administration of tho office, we have the
authority of the continuator os his chronicle. It appears
that, after the resignation ol William os Scarborough, the
eighteenth abbot,in the year1396,the conventwas divided
in the choice of a successor, some of the body giving their
votes for Williom wendover, at that time prior, others sor
Thomas Burton, “a man both religiousand well lettered’'
But Wendovcr, “conscious of being more experienced iu
“ claustral matters then worldly affairs, and preferring
“ to be subject to control rather than to beor rule,''
pressed the preference ol Burton; whose election was
accordingly ratified by the father abbot of Fountains,
assisted by the abbot of Kirlrstead. Subsequently, the
whole convent being {resembled in the chief chamberes
the guest house, the election was again declared by their
publio notary, lllaster Henry Burton of York, no one
making objection, and a public instrument was drawn up
in evidence aad duly signed.

The first step of the newly elected abbot was tc present
himself before Thomas of Woodsloek, dake of Gloucester,
wh0‚ being then lord of Holderncss, stood in the relation
of founder to the monastery, aad to offer homage. The
dukc, however, llctly refused to recognize the election
until he had been assured of it by letters under the
common scal of tlxe nronastery. Having surnielred him-
self, therefore, with this requisito certifirate, Baeton
again visited tho dukc, did duc homage, aad explained
to him the circumstances of tlrc voluntary resignation
of William of Scarlrorough, his predecessor, and 'so
returned lo tho monastery a fully installed abbot.
