Chusa III. chartularios and registers of these I know

ostaux l. A chartulary, now Lansdowne MS. 424, in the

‘Q' British Museum. It ison vellum, and of tho fourteenth
century, and consiste of 156 leaves. At folio 3 is a noto
by Sir christophor Hyldyard, showing that it belonged to
him in the year 1553,1 and attho bottom os the last page
are the initials W. K, and the date 1722, indiceting that

contains copies of papal bulis, episcopal documenta, and
roysl chartsrs, the latest dote of which is the year 1371.
These are succeeded by copies of charters, dated as lats

entries in Burton's handwn'ting at folios 31 h and 77 b.
