From these references then we learn the fact that,
notwithstanding the assertion in his preface that the
acts of the ubbots prior to his time had found no
chronicler, Burton was actually making use of one or
more works of the kind, extending from the first abbot
to the eighth, orto as late as the year 1249, vin, within
little more than a century of his own time. We learn
also that this chronicle, or one of these chronicles, was
in the form of a roll.

Thon, again, we have proof of the existence at his
time of a distinct historical piece relating to the monas-
. tery in an entry in the inventory of its library, written
by Burton himself, in the register already referred to.
The entry is in these words: “ Item, liber unus de
“ regula Sancti Benedicti, in quo martilogium (aie), in
“ quo mactatus de exordio ordinis Cistereiensis, et de
‘⁴ numero abbaciarum ordinis, et alius parvus tractatus
“de fundatione hujus monasterii.” Moreover, Burton
inserts in his work an earlier notice of the foundation
of the monastery and of the genealogy of the earls of
Albemarle, which is found in a register of Fouutains
abbey, now in the Rawlinson Collection in the Bodleian
library, N o. 449, and is printed by Dugdale in his account
of Meaux abbey.¹

That Burton made use of these earlier works is evi-
dent from the passages he refers to in them being
found in substance, and in some instanees verbatim,
in his own work. That he was eonscientious in his ex-
tracts from them we have an amusing instance in a
passage in the tract upon tithes already mentioned, in
